# Philosophy

SharingHub offers collaborative services for managing code, datasets, and AI models,
emphasizing the importance of sharing and collaboration to enhance efficiency, quality, and reuse within EO platform ecosystems.
It integrates features like code and model ranking, peer reviews, full lifecycle support, and asset discovery.

**Key features include**:

- **Lifecycle Management**: Tools and functionalities for managing the entire lifecycle of software packages, AI models, workflows,
and services, from development and testing to deployment.

- **Source Code and Asset Management**: Storage and management of source code, assets, and applications created and published by users.

- **Ranking and Peer Review**: Interfaces for ranking algorithms, software packages, datasets, and AI models.
The peer review process allows thorough evaluation and feedback, ensuring code quality and preventing unstable code from shipping.

SharingHub aligns with GitLab CE to provide a robust infrastructure, which can include ML/AI lifecycle management capabilities through
MLflow integration.

To address this, our solution extends GitLab with a dedicated web portal customized for researchers, data scientists, and AI analysts.

This extension provides:

- **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Specialized tools and interfaces for presenting services, AI models, datasets,
and their interconnections in a scientific manner.

- **Focused Development**: Enables AI researchers to concentrate on developing AI models and algorithms while benefiting
from GitLab's collaborative, version control features and MLflow service for AI models training.
