# Data

Whether for AI models, with weight files, or even datasets, there is a real need for storing big data. In SharingHub, we rely on GitLab, and therefore by definition, Git. But Git is not intended to store large volumes of data. We therefore offer two solutions to this problem:

- :simple-gitlfs: [Git LFS](./git-lfs.md)
- :simple-dvc: [DVC](./dvc.md)
