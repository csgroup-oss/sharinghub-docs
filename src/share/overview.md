# Overview

You may want to not only [Explore](../explore/overview.md) the SharingHub, but also _share_ your own work, because the SharingHub cannot be what it is without people _sharing_ their work.

The following chapters are here for that purpose! You will learn how to setup your GitLab repository in order to share it with efficiency, by answering these questions:

- How to describe my project  with [Metadata](./metadata/index.md).
- How do do I store my (sometimes heavy) [Data](./data/index.md).

Join us in this collaborative journey ðŸš€ !
