# OGC

With SharingHub, we are committed to the use of open standards, such as OGC.

The **Open Geospatial Consortium** (**OGC**) is an international consortium of more than
500 member organizations from government, academia, and industry. The primary goal
of the OGC is to enable interoperability and seamless integration of geospatial data
and services across different platforms, systems, and applications. This is achieved
through the development and promotion of consensus-based open standards for geospatial
data formats, interfaces, and protocols.

Inside of OGC, there is **OGC API**, which we try to follow as much as possible for our use-cases.
The OGC API suite of standards is a modernized approach to geospatial data access and
processing, designed to simplify the sharing and use of geospatial information
over the web. The OGC API suite consists of several individual standards, each
focusing on different aspects of geospatial data access and processing.

As of now, with our STAC API we use **OGC API - Features**, and are planning to
incorporate **OGC API - Processes** for processing.
